    "1. Main Drivers\n",
    "    * These modules will generate all the functions from the next two sections with one call and provide wrapper functions so that all the reconstructions and function calls can be done in the proper order, while avoiding cluttering up the main notebook. They come in two flavors:\n",
    "        * [Unstaggered](Tutorial-GiRaFFE_NRPy_Main_Driver.ipynb): This implementation uses only cell-centered grids. This makes it easier to avoid coordinate singularities in curvilinear coordinate systems, but is less stable shocks whose speed approaches the speed of light. \n",
    "        * Staggered: This implementation staggers the electromagnetic quantities. While this is more stable for very fast shocks, it runs the risk of sampling the staggered quantities at coordinate singularities. **TODO: Tutorial**\n",
    "1. Evolution: Find the right-hand sides of evolution equations for the conservative variables\n",
    "    1. Calculate the gauge terms for $A_k$, $-\\partial_i (\\alpha \\Phi - \\beta^j A_j)$, and $\\Phi$, $-\\partial_j (\\alpha\\sqrt{\\gamma}A^j - \\beta^j [\\sqrt{\\gamma} \\Phi]) - \\xi \\alpha [\\sqrt{\\gamma} \\Phi]$:\n",
