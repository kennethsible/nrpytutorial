    "# The Riemann Solution on $\\tilde{S}_i$ using HLLE\n",

    "This notebook documents the function from the original `GiRaFFE` that calculates the flux for $\\tilde{S}_i$ according to the method of [Harten, Lax, and von Leer](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/1025002)  and [Einfeldt](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/0725021) (HLLE), assuming that we have calculated the values of the velocity and magnetic field on the cell faces according to the piecewise-parabolic method (PPM) of [Colella and Woodward (1984)](https://crd.lbl.gov/assets/pubs_presos/AMCS/ANAG/A141984.pdf), modified for the case of GRFFE. \n",

    "The differential equations that `GiRaFFE` evolves are written in conservation form, and thus have two different terms that contribute to the time evolution of some quantity: the flux term and the source term. The PPM method is what the original `GiRaFFE` uses to handle the flux term; hopefully, using this instead of finite-differencing will fix some of the problems we've been having with `GiRaFFE_NRPy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In GRFFE, the evolution equation for the Poynting flux $\\tilde{S}_i$ is given as \n",

    "We can then see that, if we rewrite this, the right-hand side (RHS) describing the time evolution $\\partial_t \\tilde{S}_i$ consists of two terms: the flux term and the source term. The flux term in particular can be tricky, as it may be discontinuous due to shocks or other sharp features. This presents difficulties when we take finite-difference derivatives of that term, leading to the Gibbs phenomenon. So, we implement a different algorithm to take the derivative. \n",

    "The flux term itself is, as written above, $\\alpha \\sqrt{\\gamma} T^i_{{\\rm EM} j} = \\alpha \\sqrt{\\gamma} g_{j \\mu} T^{\\mu i}_{\\rm EM}$, where $T^{\\mu \\nu}_{\\rm EM} = b^2 u^\\mu u^\\nu + \\frac{1}{2} b^2 g^{\\mu \\nu} - b^\\mu b^\\nu$; the following functions will compute this value so that we can easily take its derivative later. Having reconstructed the values of $v^i_{(n)}$ and $B^i$ on the cell faces, we will now compute the value of the flux of $\\tilde{S}_i$ on each face.

Critically, these quantities depend on the Valencia 3-velocity $v^i_{(n)}$ and magnetic field $B^i$. We will not be using the normal gridfunctions for these, but rather the ones that we have previosly calculated on the left and right sides of the cell faces using the [Piecewise Parabolic Method](Tutorial-GiRaFFE_NRPy_Ccode_library-PPM.ipynb).\n",

The flux term we need to add to the RHSs is a finite difference of the fluxes we have calculated so far, so these cannot be simple pointwise operations. However, we also cannot use NRPy+'s build-in finite-differencing tools because of how we store the reconstructed quantities (that is, quantities reconstructed on the $i-1/2$ face is stored at point $i$ in memory), which makes the FD template we need look just like a forward finite-differencing template, which NRPy+ cannot do. So, we must write the code to read and write data from and to memory ourselves.

    "This computes phase speeds in the direction given by flux_dirn. Note that we replace the full dispersion relation with a simpler one, which overestimates the maximum speeds by a factor of ~2. See full discussion around Eqs. 49 and 50 in [Duez, et al.](http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0503420.pdf). In summary, we solve the dispersion relation (in, e.g., the $x$-direction) with a wave vector of $k_\\mu = (-\\omega,k_x,0,0)$. So, we solve the approximate dispersion relation $\\omega_{\\rm cm}^2 = [v_A^2 + c_s^2 (1-v_A^2)]k_{\\rm cm}^2$ for the wave speed $\\omega/k_x$, where the sound speed $c_s = \\sqrt{\\Gamma P/(h \\rho_0)}$, the Alfv&eacute;n speed $v_A = 1$ (in GRFFE), $\\omega_{\\rm cm} = -k_\\mu k^\\mu$ is the frequency in the comoving frame, $k_{\\rm cm}^2 = K_\\mu K^\\mu$ is the wavenumber squared in the comoving frame, and $K_\\mu = (g_{\\mu\\nu} + u_\\mu u_\\nu)k^\\nu$ is the part of the wave vector normal to the four-velocity $u^\\mu$.
